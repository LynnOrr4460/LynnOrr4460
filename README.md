## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository focused on automation, where I explore the integration of APIs with no-code platforms and lightweight scripting. This space is a collection of projects and experiments aimed at streamlining workflows, connecting services, and building practical solutions without reinventing the wheel.

As an automation developer, Iâ€™m passionate about simplifying processes by combining the power of code with the accessibility of no-code tools. Whether it's connecting third-party APIs, automating repetitive tasks, or creating data pipelines, I believe that automation should be efficient, scalable, and as user-friendly as possible.

This repository features a mix of script-based automations (using tools like Python, JavaScript, and shell scripting) and integrations with no-code platforms such as Zapier, Make (formerly Integromat), Airtable, and Notion. My focus is on building flexible, reusable workflows that can solve real-world problemsâ€”from syncing data between apps to triggering actions based on custom logic.

Each project is documented with clear explanations, setup instructions, and insights into the tools and APIs involved. I aim to make the code accessible not just for developers, but also for power users and builders who may not write code every day but are looking to enhance their automation capabilities.

If you're interested in connecting systems, building smarter workflows, or learning how to extend no-code tools with custom scripts and API integrations, I hope this repository serves as a helpful resource. Iâ€™m always learning, experimenting, and refining these solutions, so feedback and collaboration are welcome.

Thanks for visitingâ€”feel free to explore, fork, or contribute as I continue to bridge the gap between no-code simplicity and the full potential of APIs through smart automation.
